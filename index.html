        <h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
            I am 32 years old and from Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started learning coding a few months ago and have recently decided to pursue a career as a quant trader.
            I have already programmed some algorithms with the help of a programmer friend. These projects will be published here soon as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first projects will be considered starting projects, but later on, I plan to write my own profitable trading algorithms.
        </p>
